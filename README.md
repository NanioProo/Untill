# Untill
This C++ console application allows users to input a future date (with optional time) and calculates how much time remains until that moment—displaying the difference in days, hours, and minutes.

✨ Features:
-🕒 Displays the current system date and time

-📅 Accepts a target date in the format: YYYY MM DD [HH MM]

-📊 Calculates the time remaining until the target

-🎨 Uses Windows console colors for a better user experience

-🛑 Warns if the entered date is in the past

-⏸️ Pauses at the end so the console doesn't close immediately

🧠 Example Input:
 ----------------------------------------------
| Enter your target date (YYYY MM DD [HH MM]): |
| > 2025 12 31 23 59                           |
 ----------------------------------------------
#🔧 Requirements:
-Windows OS (uses <windows.h> for color and system("pause"))

-C++11 or higher.

-Compatible compiler like MSVC or MinGW.
